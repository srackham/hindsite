# Hindsite website generator

## IMPORTANT: hindsite is currently in a pre-release phase and is not production ready
Having said that, the current release (v0.9.2) is feature-complete and has no
known significant bugs, but there are some loose ends to be tidied up (mainly
regards the documentation and the release process).

## Overview
hindsite is a static website generator. It builds static websites with optional
document and tag indexes from Markdown source documents (e.g. blogs posts,
newsletters, articles). Features:

- Stand-alone single-file executable.
- Fast site builds.
- Built-in development web server with Live Reload, file watcher and automatic
  incremental rebuilds.
- Light weight with minimal complexity.
