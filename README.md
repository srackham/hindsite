# Hindsite website generator


## IMPORTANT: hindsite is currently in a pre-release phase and is not production ready
Having said that, the current release is feature-complete and has no known
significant bugs, but there are some loose ends to be tidied up (mainly regards
the documentation and the release process).


## Overview
hindsite is a static website generator. It builds static websites with optional
document and tag indexes from Markdown source documents (e.g. blogs posts,
newsletters, articles). Features:

- Stand-alone single-file executable.
- Fast site builds.
- Built-in development web server with Live Reload, file watcher and automatic
  incremental rebuilds.
- Light weight with minimal complexity.


## Install
Download the binary for your platform from the [releases
page](https://github.com/srackham/hindsite/releases) and extract the `hindsite`
executable.

Verify the install by running the `hindsite help` command then read the [Quick
Start section](https://srackham.github.io/hindsite/#quick-start) in the
documentation.
