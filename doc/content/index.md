# Hindsite

Hindsite is a simple static site generator for personal, project and blog websites.

The overriding design criteria are simplicity and transparency.

1. Install hindsite:

    TODO

2. Create and generate a website:

    mkdir website
    cd website
    hindsite init
    hindsite build

3. View the website in your browser:

    hindsite serve

Hindsite is written in Go and it's very fast, give it a go.

See the [Hindsite Reference](reference.html).
